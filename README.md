# CS601 Web Application Development Final Project

For my Final Project, I have decided to create a NHL website. My website is divided into 4 html pages; index.html, boxscores.html, standings.html and rosters.html.
Each html file has a javascript file associated with it, which uses the NHL API, to retrieve the relevent information for the html page; such as rosters, statistics and boxscores.

# How to Rum

Simply open the index.html page in a browser and navigate through the page.
